# CijfCheckSite

A site to view your grades in a completely unnecessarily dramatic way but also kinda fun.

The HTML and CSS is really rubbish but it works so I dont want to fix it.

The txt files are - in my case - updated where I myself run [SomPlus](https://github.com/Gijs6/SomPlus). Maybe in the future I will implement the Somtoday API in the JS on the site, so your last grades are refreshed very time you visit the site.
